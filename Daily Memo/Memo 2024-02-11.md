Computation offloading is the transfer of resource intensive computational tasks to a separate processor, such as a hardware accelator, or an external platform, such as a cluster, grid, or a cloud.
Offloading to a coprocessor can be used to accelerate applications including: image rendering and mathmatical calculations. Offloading computing to an external platform over a network can provide computing power and overcome hardware limitations of a device, such as limited computational power, storage, and energy.
