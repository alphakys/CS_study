1. The device driver loads the approriate registers in the device controller.
2. keyboard(Device)에 입력된 data가 device controller의 local buffer로 transferring 된다.
3. Once the transfer of data is complete, the device controller informs the device driver that it  has finished its operation.
4. The device driver then gives control to other parts of the operating system.
5. For other operations, the device driver returns status information such as "write completed successfully"

##### <span style='color:#f7b731'>Overview</span>

Hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a signal to the CPU,  usually by way of the system bus. (There may be many buses within a computer system, but the system bus is the main communication path between the major components.) 

When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location. The fixed location usually contains the starting address wheree the service routine for the interrupt is located.
The interrupt service routine executes; on completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted computation.

The straightforward method for managing this transfer would be to invoke a generic routine to examine the interrupt information. The routine, in turn, would call the interrupt-sepcific handler.

##### What is an interrupt routine?

An interrupt routine is a small piece of code that the processor jumps to when a specific event (called an interrupt) occurs. Think of it as an emergency "subroutine" that handles urgent tasks that need immediate attention.
Examples of interrupts include key presses, timer ticks, disk I/O completion, and network activity.

##### What is a table of pointers?

Imagine a list of addresses orgainzed in a table.

##### How the processor uses the table

1. An interrupt happens(key press, timer tick)
2. The processor determines the interrupt type (keyboard interrupt)
3. It uses the interrupt type as an index to look up the address of the coresponding interrupt routine in the table
4. the processor jumps to that memory address, which points to the start of the actual interrupt routine code.
5. The interrupt routine executes, handling the event.
6. The routine returns control to the main program.

##### Hardware doesn't directly execute functions from the table.

- The table just stores memory addresses, not executable code.
- It's the processor's responsibility to use those addresses to find and execute the actual functions.



##### <span style='color:#f7b731'>Interrupt Process flow</span>

1. Device driver initiates IO
2. Initiates IO
3. input ready, output complete, or error generates interrupt signal
4. CPU receiving interrupt, transfers control to interrupt handler.
5. interrupt handler processes data, returns from interrupt.
6. CPU resumes processing of interrupted task.
