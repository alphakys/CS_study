In computer science, resource contention is <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>a conflict over access</span> to a <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>shared resource</span>.

When an MVCC database needs to update a piece of data, it will not overwrite the original data item with new data, but instead creates a newer version of the data item. Thus there are multiple versions stored. The version that each transaction sees depends on the isolation level implemented. The most common isolation level implemented with MVCC is snapshot isolation. With snapshot isolation, a transaction observes a state of the data as of when the transaction started.

MVCC provides point-in-time consistent views. Read transactions under MVCC typically use a timestamp or transaction ID to determine what state of the DB to read, and read these versions of the data. Read and write transactions are thus isolated from each other without any need for locking. However, destpite locks being unnecessary, they are used by some MVCC databases such as Oracle. Writes create a newer version, while concurrent reads access an older version.

MVCC introduces the challenge of how to remove versions that become obsolete and will never be read. In some cases, a process to periodically sweep through and delete the obsolete versions is implemented. This is often a stop-the-world process that traverses a whole table and rewrites it with the last version of each data item.

PostgreSQL can use this approach with its VACCUM FREEZE.
Other databases split the storage blocks into two parts: the data part and an undo log.

Postgresql과 다른 database는 다른 version의 piece of data의 처리에 있어서 다른 방법을 선택했다.

The data part always keeps the last committed version. The undo log enables the recreation of older versions of data. The main inherent limitation of this latter approach is that when there are update-intensive workloads, the undo log part runs out of space and then transactions are aborted as they cannot be given their snapshot.

MVCC uses timestamps, and incrementing transaction IDs, to achieve transactional consistency. MVCC ensures a transaction never has to wait to read a database object


Optimistic locking의 사용의 장점.

Pessimistic locking을 사용하면 Read lock의 반환이 모두 이뤄져야지만 write을 사용하여 data의 update를 할 수 있다. 이유는 데이터 정합성 때문에.

하지만 Optimistic lock은 Lock을 걸어서 concurrency control을 하는 것이 아니라 data에 대한 추가적인 metadata를 통하여 lock을 걸지 않았지만 Lock을 걸어 concurrency control을 한것과 같은 효과가 나기 때문에 lock이란 이름이 붙었을 뿐. version을 통한 concurrency control이 좀 더 정확한 표현이다.


Transaction ID를 통해서 unique를 부여하고.

read timestamp를 통해서 Transaction의 version의 unique함이 부여된다.

Tr_id가 increment 한다는 것은 Transaction이 committed!

##### <span style='color:#f7b731'>System Clock</span>

1. Measuring Time:
	The system clock provides a reference point for all time-related operations within the system, including
	- Scheduling tasks for execution at specific times.
	- Measuring the duration of processes or events.
	- Maintaining timestamps for file creation, modification, and access.
2. Synchronization:
	The system clock helps synchronize various components within the computer and across a network, ensuring everyone is in agreement about the current time
	- Coordinating communication between different processors (cores) within a single computer.
	- Synchronizing file systems shred across multiple devices on a network.
	- Enabling time-sensitive applications like online gaming or video conferencing to function correctly.
3. Logging and Auditing:
	The system clock plays a vital role when recording events and actions within a system:
	- Timestamping log entries to track system activity and identify potential issues.
	- Identifying the time of user logins, file modifications, and other events for security purposes
