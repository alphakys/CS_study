어떻게 하면 File locking을 할 수 있을까?
먼저 고민해보자.

File open과 File write and read는 kernel로부터 시작한다. 
그렇다면 kernel이 해당 파일에 대한 통제권을 가지고 critical section에 들어가면 해당 파일에 대한 접근을 제어하면 되지 않을까?

그리고 file metadata(inode 등등에서 file control을 할 수 있지 않을까?

File locking is a mechanism that restricts access to a computer file, or to a region of a file, by allowing only one user or process to modify or delete it at a specific time and to prevent reading of the file while it's being modified or deleted.

Most operating systems support the concept of record locking, which means that individual records within any given file may be locked, thereby increasing the number of concurrent update processes. 

Although this does prevent any other process from access to the entire physical file underlying a database. it can be more efficinet than individually locking many regions in the file by removing the overhead of acquiring and releasing each lock.

##### In Unix-like systems

Several kinds of file-locking mechanisms are avaliable in different falvors of Unix, and many operating systems supprot more than one kine for compatibility.

The most common mechanism is fcntl Two other such mechanisms are flock and lockf each of which may be implemented atop fcntl or may be implemented separately from fcntl.

Shared locks are sometimes called "read locks" and exclusive locks are sometimes called "write locks".

Thus it is possible for a database to have a concept of "shared writes" vs "exclusive writes" for example changing a field in place may be permitted under shared access, whereas garbage-collecting and rewriting the database may require exclusive access.

The application or system should be designed such that any lock is held for the shortest time possible. Data reading, without editing facilities, does not require a lock, and reading locked records is usually permissible.

#deadlock
중요!!

Deadlock is possible when incremental locking (locking one entity, then locking one or more additional entities) is used. To illustrate, if two bank customers asked two clerks to obtain therir account information so they could transfer some money into other accounts, the two accounts would essestially be locked. Theb, if the customers told their clerks that the money was to be transferred into each other's accounts, the clerks would search for the other accounts but find them to be in use and wait for them to be returned. Unknowingly, the two clerks are waiting for each other, and neither of them can complete their transaction until the other gives up and returns the account. Various techniques are used to avoid such problems.

##### <span style='color:#f7b731'>What is advisory lock?</span>
반대 : mandatory lock
내가 lock한다. 건들지마.!!

An advisory lock in the context of file systems refers to a mechanism that suggests or advises other processes to avoid accessing a specific file or resource.

Unlike mandatory locks, which enforce exclusive access and prevent other processes from reading or writing to the file even if they try, advisory locks are cooperative and rely on processes respecting the lock indications.

An "advisory lock" in the context of file systems refers to a mechanism that suggests or advises other processes to avoid accessing a specific file or resource. Unlike mandatory locks, which enforce exclusive access and prevent other processes from reading or writing to the file even if they try, advisory locks are cooperative and rely on processes respecting the lock indications.

Here's a breakdown of key points:

**Mechanism:**

- An advisory lock is typically implemented through system calls or library functions that allow a process to express its intention to access a file exclusively.
- The lock itself doesn't directly prevent other processes from accessing the file. Instead, it serves as a notification or recommendation.

**Purpose:**

- Advisory locks are useful for coordinating access between processes that should not interfere with each other's operations on a shared resource.
- They can help prevent race conditions and data inconsistencies that might arise if multiple processes concurrently modify the same file without proper coordination.

**Benefits:**

- Compared to mandatory locks, advisory locks offer greater flexibility and can be easier to implement in certain scenarios.
- They can reduce overhead compared to strict locking mechanisms, as they rely on cooperation rather than forceful access control.

**Limitations:**

- Advisory locks rely on all processes respecting the lock suggestions. Malicious or poorly written programs might ignore them, leading to potential issues.
- They don't provide guaranteed isolation like mandatory locks, so they should be used with caution in scenarios where data integrity is critical.

**Use Cases:**

- Coordinating temporary file access between multiple processes working on the same document.
- Signaling exclusive access to shared configuration files or temporary data structures.
- Implementing caching mechanisms where multiple processes might access the same cached data.

**Example:**

- Imagine two applications editing a shared configuration file. One application sets an advisory lock before reading and modifying the file to signal its intention to have exclusive access. This prompts other applications to wait until the first application releases the lock before attempting to access the file.

In summary, advisory locks offer a cooperative approach to resource coordination in file systems, but they have limitations and should be used appropriately considering their reliance on other processes respecting the lock suggestions.

##### <span style='color:#f7b731'>Optimistic Locking</span>

낙관한다. 무엇을?? 충돌하지 않을 것을.
즉, modify for reading 을 한다고 했을 때, 어떤 process든지 허락을 하지만 transaction의 commit은 하나의 tranaction에서만 일어날 것이다. 그러면 commit을 하지 못한 나머지 트랜잭션은 rollback 시킨다.

update account 
set amount = amount - 30 
and version = 2
where id = 1 and version = 1;

단점은 내가 rollback algorithm을 구상해야 한다.

Optimistic locking is used when you don't expect many collisions. It costs less to do a normal operation but if the collision does occur you would pay a higher price to resolve it as the transaction is aborted. 
##### <span style='color:#f7b731'>Pessimistic Locking</span>

충돌 자체를 피하자!! 응?

즉, reading for modify를 할 때, 나머지를 exclusive lock을 걸고 접근제한을 건다. 애초에 충돌 일으킬 여지를 주지 않겠다.!

###### Read Lock/ Shared Lock

Read Lock이 다 반환되어야지만이 write/ exclusive lock이 걸린다. 그리고 modify 가능.!!

만약 Read lock이 반환되지 않은 상태에서 write lock을 주게 되면 모두 가 계좌의 잔액에 대한 동기화가 되지 않은 상태에서 modify가 이뤄지기 때문에 문제가 생긴다.
