# Redis
- Redis operates with a single thread!
- **<span style='color:#f7b731'>Sequential Execution</span>**
	- Because of single thread operation, redis is memory safe and simplify multi thread management
- <span style='color:#f7b731'>Non-Blocking I/O</span>
	- Redis operates IO execution with asynchronously
- <span style='color:#f7b731'>Reduced Overhead</span>
	- Thread context switching and thread synchronization

### Thread context switching
- Thread context switching is the process of saving the state of a thread so that it can be restored and resume execution at a later time.
- Order of Thread context switching
	1. Save the execution state of the currently-executing thread.
	2. Select a thread for execution
	3. Restore the execution state of the new thread
	4. Pass control to the new thread.

- <span style='color:#eb3b5a'>Context Switching between processes</span> is more expensive than context switching between threads of the same process. 
- <span style='color:#3867d6'>This is because processes don't share memory with other processes.</span>
- <span style='color:#20bf6b'>핵심은 virtual memory space를 바꿀 필요가 없다.</span>

# Memcached
### - How it works?
- Consistent Hashing
	- Choosing a random node, or using the round-robin method to load-balance all the nodes, it hashes all the incoming keys, which decides the node on which the data is going to be stored.
- LRU algorithm
	- Memcached uses a predefined portion of maximum memory, so if you ask it to use a maximum of 1 GB ram, it will try not to use memory beyond that. Memcached uses the LRU algorithm to determin which data in memory has been least active, and discards it to make space for the new data.
- Memory allocation
	- SLAB??
	- The memory is divided into a fair number of pages.
	- Each page is assigned a particular slab class, according to which the page is divided into a finite number of equal-sized chunks.




# Slab
- Slab은 커널 데이터 객체 생성/파괴의 오버헤드로 인한 성능 저하를 줄이기 위해 자주 사용되는 오브젝트들을 미리 만들어 관리한다. => 한마디로 캐싱한다. 근데 커널 객체!!
- 한마디로 커널 메모리!!! phsical memory에 직접적으로 접근하는 개념의 memory 개념.

# Memo
- 스택은 함수 호출 시 전달되는 인자, 되돌아갈 주소값 및 함수 내에서 선언하는 변수 등을 저장하기 위해 사용되는 메모리 공간이다. 따라서 독립적 실행 흐름을 가진다는 것 => stack 때문!
- Context Switching -> 이것은 마치 읽고 있던 책의 페이지를 바꾸는 것과 같다. 다른 페이지를 읽으려면 기존의 읽고 있던 페이지를 기록을 하던지 페이지를 접던지 해서 caching을 하고 다른 페이지 다른 문단에 가서 책을 읽는 것과 같다. 
- Threads are the only executable units in the system. 
- 
### Thread and Thread Context Switching
- Thread 또한 context switching을 함.
- 하지만 process context switching과 비교했을 시 훨씬 overhead가 적다.
- 이유는
	1. CPU cache memory 공간의 reset이 필요 없음
		- 사실 가장 핵심적인 것은 CPU에게 얼마나 빨리 떠먹여 주는가가 핵심!!! 결국 cache!!!
	2. process context switching과 다르게 virtual memory address space의 교체가 필요 없음.
##### <span style='color:#20bf6b'>순서</span>

1. <span style='color:#3867d6'> Involuntary switch</span>
	- Some external event affercing scheduling has occured outside the currently running thread. For example, an expired timer has woken up a thread with a high priority; or the disk controller has reported that the requested part of a file has been read into the memory and the thread waiting for it can continue its execution; or the system timer has told the kernel that your thread ran out of its time quantum; and so forth.
2. <span style='color:#3867d6'>Volunrary switch</span>
	- The thread explicitly requests rescheduling through a system call. For example, it may have requested to yield the CPU to some other thread, be put asleep or wait until a mutex is released.
3. <span style='color:#3867d6'>Semi-voluntary switch</span>
	- Read I/O

##### Kernel level Thread and User level Thread
- 기존의 thread의 user-level task schdduling 방식은 1:1 model로 불리며 하나의 os thread에 하나의 user-level thread가 coupling됨.
- However, the 1:1 model can also be inefficient, especially for IO bound tasks that spend a lot of time wating for external resources. This is because the OS thread associated with the task will be blocked during theses periods, even though the task itself is not actually performing any work.
- There are two types of threads to be managed in a modern system: User thread and kernel threads.
- User threads are supported above the kernel, without kernel support. These are the threads that application programmers would put into their programs.
- Kernel threads are supported within the kernel of the OS itself. All modern OSes support kernel level threads, allowing the kernel to perform multiple simultaneous tasks and or to <span style='color:#0fb9b1'>service multiple kernel system calls simultaneously.</span> 

#### Implicit Threading
1. Thread pools
2. OpenMP
3. Grand Central Dispatch, GCD


결국에는 세상 모든 것이 제한 한정적인 상황에서 그것을 이용하기 위한 발버둥같이 느껴진다.
