OS signal -> managing process


1. Allows Python programs to interact with signals from the operating system.
2. Signals are asynchronous notifications sent to a process to indicate events like keyboard interrupts, termination requests, or system-generated events.
3. The signal library provides functions to handle these signals and define custom actions

Understanding SIGCHLD:
	- signal sent to a parent process when one of its child proccesses terminates or changes its state
	- It's a way for the operating system to notify the parent about events related to its children.

Default Behavior (ignoring SIGCHLD)
	- In Python, the defualt action for SIGCHLD is to ignore it. This means the Python interpreter won't take any immediate action when it receives this signal.
	- The rationale for this default behavior is to avoid potential interference with the parent procees's normal execution flow.

# signal
- 나의 정리
	- signal은 OS 단에서 다뤄지는 process managing tool이다.
	- 모든 process에 event가 발생했음을 process에 전달하여 process state를 관리
	- process에 구현되어야 하는 default한 handler(function)가 존재함.
	- 하지만 일부 signal에 대해서는 개발자의 손길이 필요
	- 그래서 default handler and custom handler가 존재함.
